# TS-CB
Problem data for channel scheduling problems from Corry and Bierwirth

A separate file exists for each table in the paper, for example TS-CB-T6 corresponds to data in Table 6.

Within each spreadsheet, there are two worksheets for each row of data in the corrsponding table in the paper. One worksheet contains the data for each of 10 problem instances. The other worksheet (post-scripted with X) contains data relating to solutions generated.
